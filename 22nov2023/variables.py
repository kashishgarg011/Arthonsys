'''1. Variables:

#example of integer
x=15
print('value of x is ',x,'and its datatype is ',type(x))#output is a value and its datatype


#example of string
y='Kashish Garg'
print('value of y is ',y,'and its datatype is ',type(y))#output is a value and its datatype

#example of list
a=[10,20,30,50,'hello']
print('value of a is ',a,'and its datatype is ',type(a))#output is a value and its datatype

#example of tuple
b=('hey',23,7,89)
print('value of b is ',b,'and its datatype is ',type(b))#output is a value and its datatype


#example of dictionary
c={"Name":"Kashish Garg",
   "Age":22}
print('value of c is ',c,'and its datatype is ',type(c))#output is a value and its datatype
